/**
 * Builds a position map by traversing a ProseMirror document and its corresponding JSON representation.
 *
 * @param pmDoc - The ProseMirror document node
 * @param jsonDoc - The JSON representation of the document (typically from doc.toJSON())
 * @returns A WeakMap mapping JSON nodes to their PM position ranges, or null if the structures don't match
 *
 * @remarks
 * This function performs a parallel walk of both the ProseMirror document tree and its JSON
 * representation, verifying that they have matching structure and recording the position range
 * for each JSON node.
 *
 * The position mapping follows ProseMirror's position semantics:
 * - For the root document node, positions span the entire content (0 to doc.content.size)
 * - For non-root nodes, positions include the opening and closing tokens (nodeSize)
 * - Text nodes are treated as leaf nodes with their character positions
 *
 * Validation performed:
 * - Node types must match between PM and JSON (pmNode.type.name === jsonNode.type)
 * - Child counts must match for non-leaf nodes
 * - All child nodes must be valid objects in the JSON
 *
 * Returns null if any structural mismatch is detected, indicating that the JSON does not
 * accurately represent the ProseMirror document. This can happen if:
 * - The JSON was generated from a different document
 * - The JSON was modified after generation
 * - The document uses custom node types with special serialization
