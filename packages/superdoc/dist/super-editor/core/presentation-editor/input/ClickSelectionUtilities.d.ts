/**
 * Registers a pointer click event and determines the current click count based on
 * time and distance thresholds.
 *
 * This function implements multi-click detection by tracking whether successive clicks
 * occur within a specified time window and distance threshold. This enables features
 * like double-click to select word and triple-click to select paragraph.
 *
 * @param event - The pointer event containing timestamp and position
 * @param previous - The previous multi-click state
 * @param options - Configuration for click detection
 * @param options.timeThresholdMs - Maximum time between clicks to count as rapid (typically 500ms)
 * @param options.distanceThresholdPx - Maximum pixel distance between clicks (typically 5px)
 * @param options.maxClickCount - Maximum click count to track (e.g., 3 for triple-click)
 * @returns Updated multi-click state with incremented count if thresholds are met, or reset to 1
 *
 * @remarks
 * Click count increments only if both time and distance thresholds are satisfied.
 * If either threshold is exceeded, the count resets to 1 (single click).
 * The count is capped at maxClickCount to prevent unbounded increment.
