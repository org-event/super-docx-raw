     *
     * @remarks
     * This method performs the following steps:
     * 1. Queries all elements with both data-pm-start and data-pm-end attributes
     * 2. Filters out inline SDT wrapper elements (which are metadata containers)
     * 3. If leafOnly is true (default), filters out container elements that have descendant
     *    PM-position elements, keeping only leaf elements
     * 4. Validates that pmStart and pmEnd are finite numbers with pmEnd >= pmStart
     * 5. Sorts entries by pmStart (ascending), then by pmEnd (ascending)
     *
     * The leafOnly filtering prevents indexing container elements like pages, lines, and
     * fragments which would otherwise overlap with run-level spans and complicate lookups.
     *
     * The sorting ensures that binary search operations work correctly and that entries
     * with the same start position are ordered by their end position.
     *
     * Safe to call multiple times - each call completely replaces the index. The previous
     * index is discarded.
